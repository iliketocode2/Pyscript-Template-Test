# üêçüìú PyScript with GitHub Codespaces and Copilot

_Create, customize and deploy your own [PyScript](https://pyscript.net)
website in minutes._ ‚ú®

In this template repository we have the development environment and base set
and ready to go. So that you can immediately launch your
[Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces/) environment and start
customizing your site using [Copilot](https://copilot.github.com) to help you
write code faster.

* **Who is this for?** __Anyone__ looking to create a
  [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/) site, learn web development, or test out
  Codespaces.
* **How much experience do you need?** __Zero__. You decide how much you want
  to customize based on your experience, and time available.
* **Tools needed:** _None_. No need to install anything! All you need is a web
  browser.
* **Prerequisites:** _None_. This template includes your development
  environment and deployable web app for you to create your own site.

### üöÄ Getting started

![PyScript web application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/education/codespaces-project-template-js/main/__images__/use-this-template.png "Use this Template Image Guide")
1. Select the repository owner (e.g. your GitHub account)
2. Enter a unique name for your new repository
3. Click the **Code** button
4. Navigate to the main page of the newly created repository.
5. Under the repository name, use the Code drop-down menu, and in the Codespaces tab, select **Create Codespace on main** button
6. Wait as GitHub initializes the Codespace.
7. When complete you will see your Codespace load with a terminal section at
   the bottom. Codespaces will install all the required extensions in your
   container. Once the package installs are completed, you'll be able to start
   editing and start a LiveServer to see your site.

## üóÉÔ∏è PyScript template

This repo is a GitHub template to build a PyScript web application. The goal is
to give you a template that you can immediately utilize to create your own
PyScript website through Codespaces.

The repo contains the following:

* `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`: Configuration file used by Codespaces to
  configure Visual Studio Code settings, such as the enabling of additional
  extensions.
* `config.json`: the
  [PyScript configuration](https://docs.pyscript.net/2024.6.1/user-guide/configuration/)
  used by your application.
* `index.html`: the
  [HTML page](https://docs.pyscript.net/2024.6.1/user-guide/first-steps/)
  used to load your PyScript application.
* `main.py`: the [Python script](https://pyscript.net/) to run.
* `mini-coi.js`: a
  [utility](https://docs.pyscript.net/2024.6.1/user-guide/workers/#http-headers)
  to ensure all PyScript's features are available.
* `styles.css`: the [visual aspects](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/defaulT.asp) of the page's features
* `README.md`: this file (that you're reading right now).

## Environment

This PyScript project contains everything you need so that you can immediately
open Codespaces, see it running, and deploy at any point.

Your development environment is all set for you to start.

* Visual Studio Code with the [Python plugin](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) enabled.
* The [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) plugin (so you can view your site).
* GitHub [copilot support](https://github.com/features/copilot) (if you have it enabled for your account).
